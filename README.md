# photohost
I'm currently working on changing my PHP backend + Vue frontend to Nuxt instead. However my host only supports PHP so Nuxt will be hosted on heroku for free, but heroku does not support file storage so I made a simple PHP backend to let me upload to from the Nuxt application. It also gets some EXIF data and resizes to multiple sizes.
